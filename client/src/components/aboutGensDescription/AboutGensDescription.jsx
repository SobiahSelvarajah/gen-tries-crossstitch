                Hi everyone! I'm Genevieve, I'm 26 and I 
                live in Cheshire in the UK. I started 
                stitching properly at the beginning of 
                last year but I've always dabbled in various 
                crafty things! I love Harry Potter, cats and 
                all things nature / wildlife.

                This website has been built to share my love 
                for cross-stitching as well as encouraging 
                others by posting their own work.
